## Option-Pricing-with-Binomial-Tree

Master 1 Thesis on Option Pricing (V. Mennesson, A. Goldman, B. Borne. Tutor : S. Rubenthaler)

We studied in this master thesis two methods of Option Pricing:
- with Binomial Tree for European and American Option
- with Monte Carlo for Simple Option (European, Binary, Lookback,Asian) and reduction of variance using importance sampling and control variance methods.

We implemented all those methods in C++, Python and R and analysed the results.
